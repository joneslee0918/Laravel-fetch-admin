                COURT OR BEFORE A JURY
                OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT
                YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN
                ARBITRATION.

                Any dispute between you and Fetch - Your Local Pet MarketPlace, Inc. and its agents, employees,
                officers, directors,
                principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section,
                “Fetch - Your Local Pet MarketPlace”) arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation
                or the breach,
                termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes
                about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, “Covered
                Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration in Montgomery County, Ohio administered by the
                American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in effect on the date
                thereof. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least
                60-days’ advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Fetch - Your Local Pet
                MarketPlace will provide
                such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Fetch - Your Local Pet MarketPlace and you
                must provide such
                notice by e-mail to disputeresolution @ fetchpetcare.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject
                line. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual
                discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period,
                either party may initiate arbitration.

                Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. If,
                however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to
                the costs of litigation, Fetch - Your Local Pet MarketPlace will pay as much of the filing,
                administration and arbitrator
                fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.
                If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to
                reimburse Fetch - Your Local Pet MarketPlace for all fees associated with the arbitration that Fetch -
                Your Local Pet MarketPlace paid on your
                behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.

                The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in
                equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be
                entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the
                power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives, and the
                arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be
                deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Fetch - Your Local Pet
                MarketPlace and you agree
                that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Fetch!
                Pet MarketPlace nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or
                private
                attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or
                private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found
                unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be
                enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration).
                Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these
                Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this
                section, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration
                Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).
